# Project Summary

## AI Chat Application - Complete Implementation

A modern chat interface with autocomplete search, nested comments, and real-time interactions built with Next.js 14+.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- **Autocomplete Search** - Debounced (300ms), keyboard navigation, text highlighting
- **Chat Interface** - ChatGPT-style layout with sticky headers
- **Nested Comments** - 4-level threading with full CRUD operations
- **Vote System** - Upvote/downvote with LocalStorage persistence
- **Real-time Updates** - Optimistic UI updates for all interactions

### Technical Implementation
- **Next.js 14** - App Router with Server/Client Components
- **TanStack Query** - 5-minute caching, optimistic updates
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety across the application
- **JSONPlaceholder API** - 100 real posts transformed to Q&A format
- **shadcn/ui** - Accessible, customizable components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Responsive, dark mode support

### Data Flow
1. JSONPlaceholder posts → Transformed to English Q&A
2. Search → Debounced → API → Cached → Displayed
3. User actions → Optimistic UI → LocalStorage → Persisted
